- Update the neoadjuvant script to use a derived version of the regimen variable
    which uses "end_or_lastadm" version instead of "end_int".   This can be copied
    over from the off label manuscript paper.
- update the manuscript sections to have 3 tables.
- remove repeats in the tables if not already done.
- remove same-class regimens in the table (e.g. carboplatin and cisplatin)
