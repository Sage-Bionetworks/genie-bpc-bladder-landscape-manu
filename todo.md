- Update metastatic classification
- Update the reports to have better met classification (todo still:  Section 2 and on, drug data, lines of therapy, etc).
- Either eradicate the use of the "status block" function with mets, or make it load the new met function.
- Add an investigation for people who were Stage 2+ but take a long time to have a med onc note showing them as invasive.
- Perioperative update?
- Go back and make sure the metastatic location puller is working with new met def.
- remove repeats in the tables if not already done.
- add a note to have people review the equivalence classes with carbo and cis in the regimen
- Send the following to the group:
  - Communication with Nancy.
  - Ad hoc report discussing met classification.
  - Updated reports, maybe just the clinical one would be relevant.
  - Conference dates, etc.
